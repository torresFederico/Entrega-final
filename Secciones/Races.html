            <h3>BAHREIN</h3>
            <img src="../Multimedia/images/bahrein.svg" alt="bahrein1" class="racesImg">
            <p>There was heartbreak all round for Oracle Red Bull Racing as World Champion Max Verstappen and teammate Sergio Perez were forced to retire from the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix after suffering from suspected fuel pump issues.
            For the bulk of the race Max had shadowed race leader Charles Leclerc of Ferrari and when the safety car was released after a fire halted the progress of AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly on lap 44, the field bunched and Max was presented with a chance to attack. However, following his final pit stop, Max had complained of a worsening issue with heavy steering and when the safety car left the track his problems were compounded as he reported he felt that he was also losing battery power. The pit wall informed him that it was not a battery issue, but the champion continued to lose ground.
            On lap 55 he slowed dramatically and the field swept past as he limped to the pit lane to retire. That left the hopes of the Team in the hands of Checo, and initially the Mexican driver was able to hold P3 behind the second Ferrari of Carlos Sainz and hold off Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton. But then with just two laps to go Checo radioed the Team saying he was losing power. Hamilton closed on and at the start of the final lap Checo spun in turn one, which saw Hamilton power past and the Team suffered its first double DNF since the 2020 Austrian Grand Prix.
            When the lights went out, Max made a good start from the front row but ahead of him pole sitter Charles Leclerc also got away well. And the as the pair went into turn one the Ferrari driver managed to hold onto the lead despite pressure on the outside from Max. Behind them, Checo made a good start but to his left Carlos Sainz bogged down slightly. And as the Ferrari driver clawed his way up to speed he moved across to defend against Checo’s charge. The Red Bull was forced to the inside line and as the field flowed through turn one Checo lost places to Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton and Haas’ Kevin Magnussen.
            The Mexican was soon on the attack though and on lap three he closed up to Magnussen who had locked up at turn four. The Danish driver’s mistake allowed Cheo to pass with ease and he began to chase down Hamilton. Checo was on the seven-time champion’s gearbox on lap nine and with the aid of DRS he muscled his way past the Briton into turn four to return to fourth place. At the front, Leclerc began to draw away from Max as the opening stint developed and by lap 13 the Monégasque driver, who started the race on new softs, was almost six seconds ahead of Max, who began on used tyres. The Team then pitted the world champion on lap 14 and the undercut proved powerful. Leclerc made his first stop at the end of the following tour and when he re-joined, Max was right behind the Ferrari.

            <p>Max attacked on lap 17 into turn one. He passed the Ferrari, but with following easier in the 2022 cars, Leclerc immediately fought back, retaking the lead in turn four. Max stayed close and attacked again in the same place on the following lap. But despite once again getting past the Ferrari in turn one, Leclerc again stole back the lead in turn four. Max tried for a third time on the next lap, but this time he locked up on entry and Leclerc was able to comfortably hold his lead.
            Behind them, Sainz was being pushed hard by Checo who took medium tyres in his first pit stop. After the action at the start of the stint, the remainder of the second phase of the race counted down without any significant movement at the front. Max made his second pit stop, for medium tyres, on lap 31, again seeking the undercut, but once again Ferrari reacted and thanks to a quicker pit stop the Italian squad managed to get the Leclerc back out in the lead, with Max also complaining that he had gone too easy on his tyres on his out lap.
            Sainz and Checo made their second visits to the pit lane at the end of the next tour and the Red Bull driver went for a second set of softs in order to attack Sainz, who had moved to medium compound Pirellis. Although Checo was the fastest man on the track for a spell, Sainz was able to hold position and as the laps counted down, Checo’s times began to fade.
            Behind the leading quartet, with 20 laps remaining, Hamilton held P5, though the Briton was almost 15 seconds behind the Red Bull driver. The Mercedes driver’s new teammate George Russell was sixth and Magnussen in the surprise package Haas was seventh ahead of AlpaTauri’s Pierre Gasly, the Alpine of Esteban Ocon and the second AlphaTauri of Yuki Tsunoda.
            The Team brought both Max and Checo in for a third stop on lap 44 and both took on soft tyres. That dropped Max behind Sainz and Checo fell to fifth behind Hamilton. However, Ferrari reacted by pitting Sainz, while Mercedes brought Hamilton in. That boosted Checo back to fourth place behind Sainz. Leclerc stayed on track to maintain position at the head of the field.
            It was at this point that Max began to complain of heavy steering. On lap 46, Gasly pulled over at the side of the track just after turn three with the rear of his AlphaTauri on fire. The safety car was deployed and Leclerc pitted. Max, meanwhile, was continuing to struggle, but despite his difficulties the champion stayed out on track as the safety car picked up the race leaders, who were now closely bunched with 10 laps to go. The safety car left the track at the end of lap 50 and Max attempted to wrestle his car to the end of the race. The attempt was valiant, but on lap 54, after also complaining of power issues, he was forced to retire from a suspected fuel pump issue.
            Checo then took up the gauntlet but on the start of the final lap his race was over as he spun in turn one, again with suspected fuel pump issues. With the Red Bulls removed from the race, Ferrari scored its first one-two finish since the 2019 Singapore Grand Prix. The final podium place went to Hamilton, with the Mercedes driver’s new teammate Russell in fourth. Magnussen claimed fifth place for Haas, with Alfa Romeo’s Valtteri Bottas in sixth ahead of Alpine’s Esteban Ocon, AlphaTauri’s Yuki Tsunoda, and the second Alpine of Fernando Alonso. Alfa Romeo rookie Guanyu Zhou took 10th place to score a point on his Formula One debut.</p>

            <h3>SAUDI ARABIA</h3>
            <img src="../Multimedia/images/map_saudi.svg" alt="map Saudi" class="racesImg">
            <p>When the lights went out for the start, Checo got the power down quickest to surge into the lead. Behind him, Leclerc didn’t react as quickly and was instantly put under pressure by Sainz to his right and from behind by Max, who had also made a good start from fourth place on the grid.
            As they approached turn one, Leclerc moved to the right to fend off Sainz and that gave Max the opportunity he needed. He darted down the inside and then, as Leclerc held P2, Max stole P3 from Sainz who had been slightly disadvantaged by his Ferrari teammate.
            At the front, though, Checo was already beginning to stretch his legs. With a clear track ahead, the Mexican began to forge a gap and by lap six he was more than 2.5s clear of Leclerc, with Max 1.3s off the lead Ferrari and three seconds clear of Sainz. Further back, Mercedes’ George Russell had stolen fifth from Alpine’s Esteban Ocon and the Frenchman had also been passed by teammate Fernando Alonso. The order at the top remained static until Checo called the first stint done when he pitted at the end of lap 15. The Mexican switched to hard tyres in a 2.9s second stop and emerged in fifth place, but the timing of the stop proved to be the worst possible as almost as soon as he re-joined the VSC was deployed due to Williams’ Nicholas Latifi crashing out in the final corner with the virtual caution quickly being replaced by the physical safety car.
            Max immediately pitted along with Leclerc and Sainz and when they emerged Leclerc led behind the safety car with Max second and Checo now down in third place ahead of Sainz and Russell. Behind them, Haas’ Kevin Magnussen and Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton, who had started on hard tyres, now occupied sixth and seventh respectively.
            The safety car left the track at the end of lap 20 and Leclerc held the lead ahead of Max. Checo, meanwhile, was advised by his race engineer that he would have to give up third place to Sainz on the restart as he had passed the Ferrari driver under the safety car when the Ferrari was leaving the pit lane. As the field exited turn one the Mexican slowed and Sainz cruised past to take P3.
            As the second stint developed the battle at the front between Leclerc and Max ebbed and flowed and by lap 29 Max was just 1.4s behind the Ferrari. Behind them, Sainz held third but only by the same margin, with Checo matching the Spaniard’s pace and looking for an opportunity. Russell was still fifth but behind him teammate Hamilton had claimed sixth from Magnussen.
            The complexion of the race changed again on lap 37 when Daniel Ricciardo suffered a mechanical problem and halted his McLaren just short of the pit entry. The VSC was deployed and Haas’ Kevin Magnussen pitted for new tyres.
            Almost simultaneously Fernando Alonso, also suffering with a mechanical issue, parked his Alpine close to Ricciardo’s car and the pit lane was closed by race officials. Marshals rushed to push the McLaren and the Alpine into the pit lane and the VSC caution continued to be displayed. The VSC ended on lap 41 and Max immediately went on the attack. The pit lane entry was then opened and Hamilton pitted for medium tyres and he emerged in P12.</p>
            <img src="../Multimedia/images/a-fun-battle-for-the-final-few-laps.avif" alt="battle" class="racesImg">
            <p>At the front, Max was now closing on Leclerc and on lap 42 he used DRS to close right up to the Ferrari driver.
            Max attacked at the end of the lap and swept past the Ferrari under DRS. Leclerc immediately struck back and using drag reduction on the main straight at the start of lap 43 he powered past Max to retake the lead.
            The cat and mouse game began and at the end of the lap Max attacked again on the next lap, once more closing under DRS ahead of turn 27, but this time he locked up and Leclerc held the lead as they began lap 44. With five laps to go Max attempted to make a move into turn one. Leclerc positioned his car well though and the World Champion had to back out of the attempt. He closed again rapidly, however, and at the end of the lap put his car almost alongside the Ferrari.
            That gave him the perfect opportunity at the start of lap 47, and with the aid of DRS on the main straight he swept past the Ferrari to take the lead.
            Leclerc wasn’t finished, however, and almost immediately he was on the attack, looking to pressure Max into a mistake. The Dutchman resisted well though and when the yellow flags were shown for an incident between Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll and Williams’ Alex Albon, the Monégasque driver had to back out of any assault.
            He would have one last chance, at the end on the final lap, but while Leclerc got close in turn 27 and his rear wing opened to give him an extra boost of speed it wasn’t enough and Max roared across the line to take his first victory of 2022. Behind them, Sainz held onto third to take the final podium place and Checo was forced to settle for P4. Fifth place went to Russell, with Ocon sixth ahead of McLaren’s Lando Norris. Pierre Gasly was eighth for AlphaTauri, while Magnussen’s tyre gamble under the VSC saw him finish ninth ahead of Hamilton who took the final point on offer.
